# Fivem_Emergency_Vehicle_Door_Pop
A basic lua script that allows LEO RP in fivem to engage a little more when arriving on priority calls. 


Install:
Create a folder in your fivem server resource directory.
drop the client and fxmanifest file into this folder. 
ensure folder in your server.cfg file. 

Details:
The script is setup to allow your players to set the door pop keybind on their end. 

You can modify the speed limit requirement for vehicles to be under, via the client.lua file. (warning, I wouldn't go over 10mph, to keep realism).
